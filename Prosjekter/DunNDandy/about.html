            <p>Dun D. Davis</p>
            <p>Mr. Dun is the senior partner and the unyielding engine of the firm. He views the intricate laws of time and space not with academic wonder, 
                but as a series of stubborn locks to be picked or, if necessary, kicked in. A man of few words and even less patience, Dun is a pragmatist to his core. 
                His tweed suit is perpetually rumpled from wrestling with paradoxes, his tie is always loosened as if in a constant state of rolling up his sleeves, 
                and his legal arguments are delivered with the blunt force of a blacksmith's hammer. While his partner might appreciate the historical nuance of a case, 
                Dun's only concern is the objective. He finds the problem, he fixes the problem, and he sends the bill. For Dun, justice isn't an abstract concept—it's a verdict, 
                and his job is to secure it by any means necessary across the continuum.</p>

            <p>Dandy D. Davis</p>
            <p>In perfect counterpoint stands Mr. Dandy, the firm's master strategist and connoisseur of causality. Where Dun provides the force, Dandy provides the finesse. 
                For him, temporal jurisprudence is not a brawl but an intricate art form, a grand tapestry to be appreciated and, when necessary, delicately re-woven. 
                He operates with a sartorial elegance that is itself a form of chronological camouflage, his suits perfectly tailored to the decade—or century—of his visit. 
                His legal arguments are constructed with the breathtaking complexity and beauty of a clockwork mechanism, finding victory not in the blunt instrument of a loophole 
                but in the subtle elegance of a perfectly cited, long-forgotten historical statute. His gadgets are masterpieces of polished brass and gleaming mahogany: 
                a fountain pen that can date the ink of any document in history, cuff-links that hum gently to warn of an approaching anachronism, 
                and a monocle that reveals the faint shimmer of fractured causality. Dandy believes a case is truly won not when the verdict is read, 
                but when every clause is perfect, every precedent is honored, and the timeline is left more orderly and beautiful than when they found it.
                After all, achieving justice without style is simply poor form.</p>
